\section{Harmonic maps for $F:S^k\ra S^k$}
\label{sec:harmonic-maps-skra}

\subsection{General properties}
\label{sec:general-properties}

From now on we shall set both, the domain and target manifolds to
$S^k$. We choose the coordinate frame on the domain sphere as
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:8}
  x^a=(\psi,\theta),
\end{align}
where $\psi\in(0,\pi)$ is the longitudal angle with
south pole at $\psi=0$ and $\theta$ is the set of coordinates on
$S^{k-1}$ -- the equator of $S^k$. Analogously we introduce
coordinates $(\Psi,\Theta)$ on the target sphere in which the map $F$
takes the form
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:9}
  F^A(\psi,\theta)&=(\Psi,\Theta).
\end{align}
The metric tensors for the given coordinate frames are
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:10}
  &\text{domain:}&\quad &ds^2=d\psi^2+\sin^2\psi^2ds^2\big|_{S^{k-1}}\\
  &\text{target:}&\quad &dS^2=d\Psi^2+\sin^2\Psi^2dS^2\big|_{S^{k-1}}.
\end{align}
Solving equations \eqref{eq:7} without any further assumptions
presents an impossible task, we therefore in section
\ref{sec:basic-setup} introduce a simple ansatz. Still without any
simplifications we can state the following.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:skk-energy-bound}
  For $k\ge3$ and any given map $F:S^k\ra S^k$ there is a map within
  the homotopy class of $F$ of arbitrary small Dirichlet energy.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  The proof bases on the fact that on any sphere there exists a one
  parameter group of conformal maps, which in the coordinates
  \eqref{eq:8} has the form
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:11}
    \psi_A=2\arctan(e^A\tan(\psi/2)).
  \end{align}
  The above conformal map can be depicted as dragging the whole sphere
  along the longitudal coordinates in the direction of one of its
  poles (for $A$ large, this would be the north pole). We define the
  map $F_A$ to be the composition
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:12}
    F_A=F\circ\psi_A.
  \end{align}
  As $\psi_A$ does leave the points $\psi=0$ and $\psi=\pi$ unchanged
  $F_A$ is of the same homotopy degree as $F$. Due to the conformal
  properties of the map $\psi_A$ we obtain the following energy
  density of $F_A$
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:13}
    e(F_A)_\psi=&e(F)_{\psi_A}\rho_A^2,\\
    \rho_A=&\frac{1}{\cosh A-\cos\psi\sinh A},
  \end{align}
  where $e(F)_\psi$ is the energy density of $F$ at point $\psi$.  The
  map $F$ is regular, and therefore $e(F)_{\psi_A}$ is bounded by its
  maximal value $C(F)=\max_\psi\left(e(F)_\psi\right)$ therefore
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:14}
    e(F_A)_\psi&\le C(F)\rho_A^2.
  \end{align}
  Assuming $k\ge3$, the Dirichlet energy of $F_A$ can be bounded by
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:15}
    E(F_A)&=\int_{S^k}e(F_A)dV_{S^k}\\
    &\le C(F)V(S^{k-1})\int_{0}^{\pi}\rho_A^2\sin^{k-1}\psi d\psi\\
    &\le C(F)V(S^{k-1})\max_\psi(\sin^{k-3}\psi)\int_{0}^{\pi}\rho_A^2\sin^2\psi d\psi\\
    &\le C_1(F,k)\frac{1}{1+\cosh A}.
  \end{align}
  which can be made arbitrary small by an appropriate choice of $A$. The
  above bound is not optimal, but is enough for our purposes. As the map
  $\psi_A$ leaves the north and south poles of $S^k$ unchanged, the map
  $F_A$ is of the homotopy class that $F$ and we conclude by the
  following theorem.

\end{proof}



\subsection{Harmonic map ansatz}
\label{sec:basic-setup}

We simplify our problem by assuming that $\Theta=\theta$ and
$\Psi=f(\psi)$ so the map $F$ takes the form
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:16}
  F:(\psi,\theta)\ra(f(\psi),\theta),
\end{align}
which leaves us with one function as a degree of freedom. The given
setup has been introduced in ~\cite{Eells1964} and it consists of the
idea that, after removing the poles, $S^k$ can be treated as
$(0,\pi)\times S^{k-1}$, for which we can use remarks \ref{rem:1} and
\ref{rem:2} with $F_1=f$ and $F_2=\id$.\\

For $F$ to be continuous, we require that
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:17}
  \lim_{\psi\ra0}f(\psi)=n\pi\quad\lim_{\psi\ra\pi}f(\psi)=m\pi.
\end{align}
Moreover, closing the domain of $\psi$ will not have any implications
as long as $F$ is regular so we can drop the limits from \eqref{eq:17}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:18}
  f(0)=n\pi\quad f(\pi)=m\pi.
\end{align}
The number $\lvert n-m\rvert$ stands for the homotopy degree of a
map.\\

The Dirichlet energy of the considered map has now a more transparent
form
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:En_Sk}
  E(f)=\frac{1}{2} V(S^{k-1})\int_{0}^{\pi}
  \left(f'^2+(k-1)\frac{\sin^2f}{\sin^2\psi}\right) \sin^{k-1}\psi
  d\psi.
\end{align}
Where we have changed the argument of $E$ from $F$ to $f$ as
effectively it is a functional of $f$. The term $V(S^{k-1})$ has no
qualitative impact on the behaviour of the system and we shall drop it
from now on. The energy density of \eqref{eq:En_Sk} with the volume
term $V(S^{k-1})$ dropped is
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:19}
  e(f)=\frac{1}{2}\left(f'^2+(k-1)\frac{\sin^2f}{\sin^2\psi}\right).
\end{align}
By the definition \ref{def:regular-map}, the map $f$ is regular if
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:20}
  e(f)=\frac{1}{2}\left(f'^2+(k-1)\frac{\sin^2f}{\sin^2\psi}\right)<\infty.
\end{align}
The Dirichlet energy of $f$ is
\eqref{eq:En_Sk}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:21}
  E(f)=\int_0^\pi e(f)\sin^{k-1}\psi d\psi\ge0.
\end{align}

Critical points of $E(f)$ are solutions to the corresponding
Euler-Lagrange equation
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:f_psi_EL} \frac{1}{\sin^{k-1}\psi}\left(\sin^{k-1}\psi
    f'\right)'-\frac{(k-1)}{2}\frac{\sin2f}{\sin^2\psi}=0.
\end{align} with the boundary values
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:22} f(0)=n\pi\quad f(\pi)=m\pi.
\end{align} The equation \eqref{eq:f_psi_EL} has trivial solution
$f=n\pi$ of homotopy degree zero for which $E(f)$ attains absolute
minimum: $E(n\pi)=0$. By remark \ref{rem:1}, the identity map
$f=\psi+n\pi$ is also the solution but of the homotopy degree one.
Because in general, the symmetry
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:23} E(f+n\pi)=E(f)
\end{align} implies that any stationary point of $E$ remains
stationary after being translated by $n\pi$ we henceforth drop the
inessential ``$+n\pi$'' to simplify the notion of possible
solutions. By the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:24}
  f&\ra \bar{f}=\pi-f,\\
  E(f)&\ra E(\bar{f})=E(f),
\end{align}
every possible critical point will have its partner of the same
homotopy degree. This is true unless $f$ is invariant under
\eqref{eq:24}, but the only such case is $f_e=\pi/2$ which is not
continuous thus not harmonic. (TODO: it does however play an important
role and is described in grater detail in appendix). To be consistent
with \cite{Bizon1997} we shall denote the constant and identity
solutions as
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:25}
  f_0=0\quad f_1=\psi.
\end{align}
These, along with their images $\bar{f}_0$ and $\bar{f}_1$ are the
only solutions to \eqref{eq:f_psi_EL} known in the closed form. More
detailed analysis of \eqref{eq:f_psi_EL} is contained in
\cite{Bizon1997} and \cite{Corlette2001}, where the infinite family of
regular solutions for $3\le k\le6$ has been found. Following the
notation in \cite{Bizon1997}, we denote the solutions as $f_n$, where
$n\in\mathbb{N}_0$. The parametrization by $n$ is motivated by the
property that $f_n$ has exactly $n$ intersections with $\pi/2$ and
$n-1$ extrema. Each of $f_n$ is of homotopy degree zero for $n$ even
or one for $n$ odd and stays inside the box $[0,\pi]\times[0,\pi]$.
To be consistent with \eqref{eq:25} we set $f_n(0)=0$. First few such
harmonic maps are depicted in figure \ref{fig:Harmonic_maps}. From
\cite{Bizon1997} it also follows that the solutions obey the following
parity relation
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:34}
  f_n(\psi)=(-1)^n f_n(\pi-\psi).
\end{align}

\begin{figure}[h]

  \label{fig:Harmonic_maps}
  \input{./graphics/Harmonic_static_to_multiplot}
  \caption{The first six non-trivial solutions to \eqref{eq:f_psi_EL}}
\end{figure}

In \cite{Corlette2001} the authors proved that each of $f_n$ is of
index $n$ therefore for each $f_n$ there are $n$ directions along
which the energy decreases. From the last statement it follows that
there are no local minima of $E(f)$ apart from $f_0$. As we will need
the following property later on we introduce it in a form of the
theorem
\begin{theorem}[Wald,Corlette]
  \label{thm:harmonic-map-index}
  There are no local minima of $E(f)$ apart from $f=n\pi$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  This can be also proved by showing that for each $f_n$ there is at
  least one direction $v$ for which the Hessian
  \begin{align}\label{eq:26}
    \delta^2E(f_n)(v,v) &=\int_0^{\pi} \left(
      v'^2+(k-1)\frac{\cos2f_n}{\sin^2\psi}v^2 \right)\sin^{k-1}\psi
    d\psi\\
    &=(v,\mathcal{L}_n v),\\
    \mathcal{L}_nv&=-\frac{1}{\sin^{k-1}\psi}\left(\sin^{k-1}\psi
      v'\right)'+(k-1)\frac{\cos2f_n}{\sin^2\psi}v
  \end{align}
  is negative unless $n=0$.

  It turns out that the conformal Killing
  field
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:27}
    K=\sin\psi\frac{\partial}{\partial\psi}
  \end{align}
  connected to \eqref{eq:11} generates such $v$, namely for $v=\sin\psi
  f_n'(\psi)$ by \eqref{eq:strange_variation} we have
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:28}
    \mathcal{L}_n v&=(2-k)v\\
    \delta^2 E(f_n)(v,v)&=(v,\mathcal{L}_n v)=(2-k)\lVert v\rVert^2<0.
  \end{align}
  This construction does not hold for $n=0$ in which case $v$ is the
  null direction.
\end{proof}
