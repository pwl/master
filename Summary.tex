The gradient flow provided us with the means to not only obtain the
unstable harmonic maps between spheres but also allowed the

(in progress)


The results of section \ref{cha:gradient-flow} gave us a
better understanding of what are the possible final states of
evolution under the gradient flow. It has been demonstrated that even
with the possibly singular behaviour, gradient flow can be used as a
tool for determining the possible saddle-type harmonic maps between
spheres by assuming some certain symmetries on the initial
conditions. Still the situation becomes significantly harder if the
stationary points of the
Dirichlet energy is not known a priori.\\
