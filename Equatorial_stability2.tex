\subsection*{The case $k\in\Gamma_2$}

As the deficiency indices pair is $<2,2>$ we would end up with the
possible self-adjoint extensions of $K$ parametrized by $U(2)$. To
simplify matter a bit we shall impose some arbitrary conditions on the
domain of $K^*$, by restricting it to functions which are symmetric or
antisymmetric. Such restricition is motivated by the following
chapters, where we focus on symmetric or antisymmetric solutions to
\eqref{eq:en_flow}. Let us introduce $K_+$ and $K_-$ each acting on
either symmetric or antisymmetric subspaces of $C_0^\infty(0,\pi)$.

By the similar reasoning as in (Thm1) we conclude, that each, $K_1$
