\section*{Equatorial map}

As the equatorial map is a non continuous nontrivial solution to
\eqref{eq:f_psi_EL} in order for our bisection argument to work we
have to prove that it does not interfere with the dynamics meaning
that its index is infinite. The eigenproblem for $f=0$ yields

\begin{align*}
  Lv=v''+(k-1)\cot{\psi}v'+\frac{(k-1)}{\sin^2\psi}v=\lambda v
\end{align*}
