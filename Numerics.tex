\section{Numerical realization of the bisection}
\label{sec:numer-real-mount}

The procedure described in \ref{sec:bisection} can be easily realized
by solving the PDE \eqref{eq:en_flow} numerically. For $H_+$, we start
by choosing $g_+$ to be
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:98}
  g_+(\psi)=\sin\psi.
\end{align}
Then, the proper $A^*$ is found by bisection between the blow-up and
the convergence to $0$. As the bisection cannot yield an exact value
of $A^*$ (due to the finite machine precision) we are not able to
reach precisely the saddle point. Rather, as we are starting a bit off
the border between attractors, the solution slides along it reaching
the neighbourhood of $f_2$ along its stable direction, it stays there
for some time but then starts to move away, slowly decaying along the
unstable direction to finally either fall into $0$ or blow up. The
smaller the numerical error of $A^*$ the closer we get to the border
and the longer solutions stays near $f_2$.\\

From the numerical solutions to PDE \eqref{eq:en_flow} we can read off
the quantities involved in approaching and leaving the neighbourhood
of $f_2$. These are the first two modes of $f_2$ along with their
respective eigenvalues as presented in \eqref{eq:69}. To obtain the
eigenvalues $\lb{2}{0,2}$ we use the function $\partial_t\partial_\psi
f\big|_{\psi=0}$ which, while in a close neighbourhood of $f_2$ is
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:99}
  \partial_t\partial_\psi
  f\big|_{\psi=0}=C_0e^{-\lb{2}{0}t}+C_2e^{-\lb{2}{2}t}.
\end{align}
After obtaining the data points from numerically solving PDE
\eqref{eq:en_flow}, we fit \eqref{eq:99} with $C_{0,2}$ and
$\lb{2}{0,2}$ as free parameters.  $C_{0,2}$ depend on the
normalization of the unknown functions $v_{0,2}$ and their numerical
values are insignificant to us. The same relation can be used to
determine $\lb{3}{1,3}$ while close to $f_3$ by
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:101}
  \partial_t\partial_\psi
  f\big|_{\psi=0}=C_0e^{-\lb{3}{1}t}+C_2e^{-\lb{3}{3}t},
\end{align}
and similarly for $f_{0,1}$
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:100}
  \partial_t\partial_\psi f\big|_{\psi=0}&=D_{0}e^{-\lb{0}{0}} \\
  \label{eq:102}
  \partial_t\partial_\psi f\big|_{\psi=0}&=D_{1}e^{-\lb{1}{0}}.
\end{align}

The results from fitting to \eqref{eq:99} and \eqref{eq:101} compared
to numerically solving \eqref{eq:42} are shown in the table
\ref{tab:Lambda_comp}.

\section{Details of numerical calculations}
\label{sec:deta-numer-calc}

Both, the eigenproblem and the heat flow have been simulated using
the programs written in ANSI C and using double precision
arithmetic. The GSL library provided the set of standard time marching
procedures using Runge-Kutta algorithms \cite{Galassi}.\\

ODE \eqref{eq:f_psi_EL} have been solved by shooting from
$(\psi,f)=(0,0)$ to the saddle points $(\pi,0)$ and $(\pi,\pi)$.
Eigenproblem has been solved parallel to the ODE \eqref{eq:f_psi_EL}
and eigenvalues have been obtained by the shooting method as well. In
both problems we have used the series approximation to start near
$(0,0)$ but not at $(0,0)$, as $(0,0)$ is a saddle point.\\

The PDE \eqref{eq:33} have been solved using the methods of lines with
the derivatives on r.h.s. of \eqref{eq:33} approximated by the three
point stencils (order $2$ for the first derivative, order $1$ for the
second derivative). Stencils were symmetric inside the grid and
asymmetric on both of its edges. The time marching was run by the
Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (4,5) method from the GSL
library\cite{Galassi}. The details of the simulations giving rise to
the figures \ref{fig:snapshot_f2}--\ref{fig:Stages_f3} are given in
table \ref{tab:num_details}.
