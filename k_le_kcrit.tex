\section*{Dimension $3\le k\le6$}

Equatorial map does not interfere with the global dynamics of the
system Apart from being linearly stable, $f_0$ and $\bar{f}_0$ are
separated (TODO: in what sense?) global minimas of energy functional
($E(f_0)=E(\bar{f}_0)=0$), so from the monotonicity of the energy we
would expect that for generic initial data the solution should fall
into one of such attractors. However, we shall see that in the phase
space there exists the set of solutions that fall to neither of the
attractors and thus imply the existence of nontrivial solution to
\eqref{eq:f_psi_EL}.
