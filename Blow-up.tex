\section{Blow-up}
\label{sec:blow-up}

As we mentioned, apart from the first global attractor $f_0$ there
exists its image by the reflection symmetry $\bar{f}_0=\pi$ which is
also a global minimum of the energy. It turns out that before reaching
the second attractor the spatial derivative of the solution blows up
at the edges of the interval $[0,\pi]$.\\

This statement was however verified by the numerical simulations only
as the proof of such theorem would exceed the level of this thesis by
far. This is due to the fact, that apart from the blow up scenario
presented here, there might exist also some other scenarios. Also the
stability analysis proposed here is only local (linear), and it might
turn out that for some large enough perturbations the blow up would
exhibit different behaviour.\\

We now proceed to the explanation of the proposed blow up mechanism.
The blow up can be localized only on the edge of the interval
$[0,\pi]$. This can be argued by the fact that the energy
\eqref{eq:En_Sk} decreases, so is finite for all times.  This in turn
implies that $f'$ has to be locally $L^2$ for all times inside the
open interval $(0,\pi)$. However, on the sides of the interval the
measure tends to zero and the discontinuity at $\psi=0$ or $\psi=\pi$
does not disagree with the finiteness of the energy. We conclude, that
the blow up is localized at the boundary. Because of the reflection
symmetry $f(\psi)\ra f(\pi-\psi)$ of the Euler-Legendre equations we
can focus on one of the edges solely, lets say $\psi=0$. We write the
equation \eqref{eq:en_flow} up to first corrections in $\psi$ to
obtain
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:2}
  \partial_t
  h=h''+\frac{(k-1)}{\psi}h'-\frac{k-1}{2}\frac{\sin2h}{\psi^2}+\mathcal{O}((h/\psi^2)^2).
\end{align}
This equation has the scaling symmetry of the form
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:6}
  \psi&\ra\lambda\psi \\
  (T-t)&\ra\lambda^2(T-t)
\end{align}
for some arbitrary $T$. We therefore use the self-similar variables of
the form
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:3}
  y=\frac{y}{\sqrt{T-t}}\quad s=-\log(T-t)\quad H(s,y)=h(t,\psi),
\end{align}
to transform \eqref{eq:2} into
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:4}
  \partial_s
  H=H''+\left(\frac{(k-1)}{y}-\frac{y}{2}\right)H'-\frac{k-1}{2}\frac{\sin2H}{y^2}.
\end{align}
The given change of variables is tuned to the analysis of the
self-similar type of blow up which is the stationary points of the
above equation. If $H_0$ is such stationary point we have
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:5}
  H_0=H_0(y)=H_0\left(\frac{\psi}{\sqrt{T-t}}\right),
\end{align}
this $H_0$ is sometimes also called the self-similar anasatz. The
intuition behind such approach is that given an initial data
$h(0,\psi)=H_0(\psi/\sqrt{T})$, the solution to \eqref{eq:2} will
shrink with the rate $1/\sqrt{T-t}$ until it reaches some singular
state at $t=T$. Now, by the fact that the solution has to be regular
for any finite $\psi>0$ and any time $t$ including $t=T$ we have to
impose the condition on $H_0$
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:1}
  \forall{\psi>0}:\lim_{t\ra
    T}H_0\left(\frac{\psi}{\sqrt{T-t}}\right)=H_0(\infty)<\infty.
\end{align}
Such requirement, together with $0=f(t,0)=H(s,0)$, gives us the proper
boundary conditions for possible static solutions to \eqref{eq:4}. We
are therefore looking for the possible solutions to the ODE
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:7}
  H_0''+\left(\frac{(k-1)}{y}-\frac{y}{2}\right)H_0'-\frac{k-1}{2}\frac{\sin2H_0}{y^2},\\
  H_0(0)=0\quad H_0'(\infty)=0.
\end{align}
The existence of solutions to \eqref{eq:7} were proved in [] and
[]. Both authors have found the countable family of solutions
$\{H_n\}_{n\ge0}$ displaying some interesting properties (possibly
mentioned in the appendix), with the important one being the fact that
$n$-th solution has exactly $n$ extremas.\\

If we want the possible solution $H_n$ to appear as a final sate of
some class of the initial data broader than $H_n$ itself, we
additionally demand that $H_n$ is linearly stable. The stability
analysis leads to the eigenproblem of the operator
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:8}
  A_n u=u''+\left(\frac{(k-1)}{y}-\frac{y}{2}\right)u'-(k-1)\frac{\cos2H_n}{\sin
    y^2}u.
\end{align}
Using the identity \eqref{eq:strange_variation}, one can check, that
$A_n$ is bounded, self-adjoint and possesses an eigenvector $yH_n'(y)$
to the eigenvalue $-1$ (TODO:check the quantity). By the standard
results of the Sturm-Liouville theory we know that the eigenvector of
$A_n$ to the smallest eigenvalue shall have no zeroes at all, and the
eigenvectors to the successive eigenvalues ordered by magnitude shall
have one zero more then the previous ones. By this fact, and by the
number of zeroes of $H_n'$ we deduce that $A_n$ has $n$ eigenvalues
smaller that $-1$. This leaves us with the hypothesis that there are
no eigenvalues in the interval $(-1,0]$ which, by the time of writing
this thesis, can be verified only by numerical calculations.\\
The prescription $yH_n'(y)$ for the unstable mode, common for all the
static solutions, originates from our arbitrary choice of the blow up
time $T$, without the restrictions on the initial data. As it was
already mentioned, author is not aware of any explicit criterion for
the given initial data to blow up, not to even mention the time of the
blow up. Now as the coordinate system \eqref{eq:3} is fine tuned to
match the blow up time $T$, we shall ask what happens if the real blow
up time is a bit different, lets say $T'=T+\delta$. We shall have
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:9}
  H_0\left(\frac{\psi}{\sqrt{T+\delta-t}}\right)
  &=H_0\left(\frac{\psi}{\sqrt{T-t}}\right)-\delta\frac{1}{2}\frac{\psi}{(T-t)^{3/2}}H_0'\left(\frac{\psi}{\sqrt{T-t}}\right)+\mathcal{O}(\delta^2)\\
  &=H_0(y)-\delta\frac{1}{2} e^{-(-1)s} \underbrace{yH_0'(y)}_{\text{unstable
    mode}}+\mathcal{O}(\delta^2)
\end{align}
which means that the change of the blow up time by $\delta$ results in
the exponentially increasing perturbation in the coordinates
\eqref{eq:3}, thus the mode $yH_n'(y)$ arises from the coordinate
system not tuned to the blow up time.

Assuming that the last hypothesis (...) holds, the only stable blow up
profile is $H_0$. The more detailed analysis of the blow up scenario
and the possibility of continuation after the blow up will show up in
the, now in preparation, paper.
