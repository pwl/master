\section{Blow-up}
\label{sec:blow-up}

Although the theorem \ref{thm:Struwe} states that some kind of
singular behaviour will occur, it does not tell what form will it
take. We shall now turn onto the mechanism of the blow up for the
gradient flow of the maps $S^k\ra S^k$.\\

From now on we assume that the blow up time $T$ is known a priori. By
symmetry, the blow up can be localized only on the edges of the
interval $[0,\pi]$.%(Jak to łatwo pokazać?).\\

Because of the reflection symmetry $f(\psi)\ra f(\pi-\psi)$ of the
gradient flow equations we can focus our analysis on one of the edges,
lets say $\psi=0$. Also as the possibly uncontrolled behaviour is
expected only within some small neighbourhood of a pole of $S^k$ where
the curvature of the domain won't play any role so we change the
domain manifold to $\mathbb{R}^k$ being the space tangent to $S^k$ at
$\psi=0$. Therefore in this section we will analyse the behaviour of
the gradient flow for maps $\mathbb{R}^k\ra S^k$ satisfying the ansatz
analogous to \eqref{eq:18} but with the metric tensors of the domain
and the target manifolds given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:71}
  &\text{domain:}&\quad &ds^2=dr^2+r^2ds^2\big|_{S^{k-1}}\\
  &\text{target:}&\quad &dS^2=dh(r)^2+\sin^2h(r)dS^2\big|_{S^{k-1}}.
\end{align}
The role of $\psi$ is then taken by the radial variable $r$ and $f$ is
replaced by $h$. The Dirichlet energy of $h$ is
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:72}
  E(h)=\frac{1}{2}\int_0^\infty \left(h'^2+(k-1)\frac{\sin^2
      h}{r^2}\right)r^{k-1}dr,
\end{align}
from which the following tension field can be derived
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:73}
  \tau(h)=h''+\frac{(k-1)}{r}h'-\frac{k-1}{2}\frac{\sin2h}{r^2}.
\end{align}
The Euler-Lagrange equations for the stationary point of $E(h)$ are
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:74}
  &\tau(h)=0,\\
  &h(0)=0,\quad h(\infty)=m\pi.
\end{align}
The boundary condition at $\infty$ follows from the finiteness of
$E(h)$. As in the case of the maps $S^k\ra S^k$, \eqref{eq:72} has no
stable stationary points apart from $n\pi$. This can be shown using
the conformal transform of $r_A:\mathbb{R}^k\ra\mathbb{R}^k$ and the
rescaled function $h_A$ defined as follows
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:75}
  r_A(r)=e^A r,\quad h_A=h\circ r_A.
\end{align}
The energy of $h_A$ is
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:76}
  E(h_A)=e^{(2-k)A}E(h)
\end{align}
and therefore for any $h\ne n\pi$ the energy can be decreased by
rescaling the domain manifold. Also the tension field scales as
follows
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:77}
  \tau(h_A)_r=e^{2A}\tau(h)_{r_A}
\end{align}
where $\tau(h)_r$ is the tension field at the point $r$. The gradient
flow for $E(h)$ is defined as
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:78}
  \begin{split}
    &\partial_t h=\tau(h),\\
    &h(0)=0,\quad h(\infty)=m\pi.
  \end{split}
\end{align}
The simple scaling property of the tension field motivates the ansatz
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:79}
  h(t,r)=H(e^{A(t)}r).
\end{align}
The idea behind such ansatz is that the solutions to \eqref{eq:78}
could consist of a constant profile sliding along the path generated
by the conformal transform. Substituting \eqref{eq:79} to
\eqref{eq:78} gives us
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:80}
  A'(t)e^{-2A(t)}yH'(y)=\tau(H)_y.
\end{align}
$H$ is the function of $y$ only, so the term involving $t$ has to be
constant and we get
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:81}
  &A'(t)e^{-2A(t)}=C,\\
  \label{eq:82}
  &e^{2A}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2C(T-t)}},\\
  \label{eq:83}
  &CyH(y)=\tau(H)_y.
\end{align}
The choice of the sign of $C$ corresponds to the choice between the
solutions which expand or shrink in time. The possibly singular
behaviour is displayed only by the function which shrinks in time
because if $H$ solves \eqref{eq:83} its first spatial derivative at
$r=0$ is
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:84}
  \partial_r\left[ H(y)\right]_{r=0} =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2C(T-t)}}H'(0).
\end{align}
From \eqref{eq:83}, by the equation similar to \eqref{eq:46}, we know
that the only possible asymptotic behaviour of $H$ at $y=0$ fulfilling
$H(0)=0$ is $H\sim y$, therefore $H'(0)\ne0$. We conclude that for
$C>0$ the quantity \eqref{eq:84} blows up in time $T$. In the
literature this type of singularity is called the type I blow-up.
% (czy napisac cos wiecej na ten temat?).
We can fix $C$ to $1/2$ by setting the argument of $H$ to
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:85}
  y&=\frac{r}{\sqrt{T-t}},\\
  \label{eq:86}
  \frac{1}{2}yH'(y)&=\tau(H)_y.
\end{align}
By the fact that the solution to \eqref{eq:86} has to be regular for
any $r>0$ and any time $t$ including $t=T$ we have to impose the
condition on $H$
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:87}
  \forall{r>0}:\lim_{t\ra T}
  \left|H\left(\frac{r}{\sqrt{T-t}}\right)\right|=\left|H(\infty)\right|<\infty.
\end{align}
Such requirement, together with $0=f(t,0)=H(0)$, gives us the proper
boundary conditions for possible static solutions to \eqref{eq:91}. We
are therefore looking for the solutions to the ODE
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:88}
  \begin{split}
    &H''+\left(\frac{(k-1)}{y}-\frac{y}{2}\right)H'-\frac{k-1}{2}\frac{\sin2H}{y^2}=0,\\
    &H(0)=0,\quad H'(\infty)=0.
  \end{split}
\end{align}

There is also another approach to obtaining \eqref{eq:88} called a
self-similar ansatz. It consist of setting $h=H(y)$ with $y$ as in
\eqref{eq:85} a priori to solving \eqref{eq:81}. It took its name from
the fact that such ansatz is invariant under the self-similar symmetry
of \eqref{eq:78} given by
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:89}
  r&\ra\lambda r,\\(T-t)&\ra\lambda^2(T-t).
\end{align}
The complete set of self-similar variables consists of $y$ and the
logarithmic time $s$ defined by the relations
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:90}
  y=\frac{r}{\sqrt{T-t}},\quad s=-\log(T-t),\quad h(t,r)=H(s,y).
\end{align}
In such variables \eqref{eq:78} takes the form
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:91}
  \partial_s
  H=H''+\left(\frac{(k-1)}{y}-\frac{y}{2}\right)H'-\frac{k-1}{2}\frac{\sin2H}{y^2}.
\end{align}
The self-similar solution $H=H(y)$ is therefore a stationary point of
\eqref{eq:91}.\\

Fan \cite{Fan1999} used ODE techniques to prove the existence of the
family of solutions to \eqref{eq:88} $H_n$, $n\ge0$, for $3\le k\le6$
with the structure similar to that of the harmonic maps between
spheres. As in the case of $f_0$, there is the trivial solution
$H_0=0$. Then, for $n\ge1$ each $H_n$ has the nodal number $n$, $n-1$
extrema and $H_n\in[0,\pi]$. Also the index of $H_n$, albeit not known
analytically, can be found numerically to be $n$.

However, there is one major difference. For $n\ge1$ each $H_n$
possesses one unstable mode which turns out to be the artifact of the
self-similar variables \eqref{eq:90}. As we recall, we have chosen the
blow up time $T$ a priori and the self-similar variables \eqref{eq:90}
are fine tuned to match this specific time. We shall ask what happens
if the blow-up is realized by $H_n$, but it occurs at time $T'$ which
is a bit different from $T$, lets say $T'=T+\delta$. In such situation
we have
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:92}
  \begin{split}
    H_n\left(\frac{r}{\sqrt{T+\delta-t}}\right)
    &=H_n\left(\frac{r}{\sqrt{T-t}}\right)-\delta\frac{1}{2}\frac{r}{(T-t)^{3/2}}H_n'\left(\frac{r}{\sqrt{T-t}}\right)+\mathcal{O}(\delta^2)\\
    &=H_n(y)-\frac{\delta}{2} e^{s}
    yH_n'(y)+\mathcal{O}(\delta^2)
  \end{split}
\end{align}
which means that the change of the blow up time by $\delta$ results in
the exponentially increasing perturbation along the mode $yH_n'$. As
this mode arises due to the ambiguity in the choice of the
self-similar variables it is also called the gauge mode and does not
appear if $T$ is chosen appropriately ($\delta=0$). This means that,
for the right choice of $T$ and $n\ge1$, $H_n$ has index $n-1$, and
thus $H_1$ is linearly stable. Therefore, apart from the trivial
solution $H_0$, there is one more final state of evolution as
$s\ra\infty$ available for generic initial data, the state $H_1$ which
is the profile of the self-similar blow-up solution. We can once again
use Theorem \ref{thm:Struwe} applying it to the initial boundary
problem \eqref{eq:78} to claim that if $m\ne0$ the blow-up will occur,
and as $H_1$ is the only stable solution to \eqref{eq:91}, the blow-up
will be of type I (to chyba zbyt silne stwierdzenie). (TODO: rysunek
$H_1$)
