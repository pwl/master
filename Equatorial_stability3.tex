\subsection{Case $k\in\Gamma_3$}
\label{sec:case-kingamma_3}

TODO:whole section\\

When the domain \eqref{eq:13} from section \ref{sec:case-kingamma_2}
no longer produces the self-adjoint extension we shall use other means
to present a suitable self-adjoint extension. As mentioned in the
previous section, the natural choice of the domain led us to the
continuity of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues with varying $k$ for
$\Gamma_1\cup\Gamma_2$. We shall now choose one of the self-adjoint
extension by expanding the continuity condition to $\Gamma_3$. We want
the set
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:22}
  f_m(\psi)=\sqrt{\sin\psi}P_{\alpha+m}^{-\alpha}(\cos\psi)
\end{align}
to span the domain of the possibly self-adjoint operator $K_3$. The
choice \eqref{eq:13} is not the right one, because its adjoint allows
both solutions as both of them fall off to zero at the edges.
